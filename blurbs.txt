Our Core Values

Seeing is Believing 
Nearly all conversations on dating apps fizzle out before a real date ever happens. Our app helps guide you toward that genuine in-person connection without having to fret over ghosting.

Safety First
As the first dating app to facilitate both matching and arranging, Matcha offers many robust features to ensure your safety during each date. Other dating apps leave their users completely on their own for arranging the date, leading to unnecessary risk and anxiety with regards to user safety.

Hassle-free
Our matching and date recommendation algorithms are designed to help you succeed. We will find the perfect spot for both you and your partner so you can focus on each other. 

No experience? No problem
Our app caters to both dating app newbies and pros alike, taking away the struggles of gauging mutual interest and stressing over organizing the date yourself.


What comes next?

It only gets better
Our team is committed to helping people foster stronger relationships and find the one. We have many revolutionary features that we can’t wait to introduce after launch. 

Our ears are open
